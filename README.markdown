# LPKit-Examples

Example app showing off the current parts of [LPKit](http://github.com/luddep/LPKit).  Uses a Aristo-like theme for the custom controls, see cappuccino docs on how to compile & use themes.

A static version may be found at [http://luddep.se/static/LPKit-Examples](http://luddep.se/static/LPKit-Examples).


## Building

### Initialize and link `LPKit` as a submodule

First run

	$ git submodule init
	$ git submodule sync
	$ git submodule update
	
so `LPKit` is cloned as a submodule.  Then, go into its directory, and run

	$ jake symlink-narwhal

or run it where your copy of `LPKit` is.  The copy on which you run `jake symlink-narwhal` would be used as the implicit copy when you build `LPAristo`.

### Build `LPAristo`

After having a copy of `LPKit` registered, go inside `LPAristo`, and run `jake` there.

### Initialize the Cappuccino framework

Finally, go outside of the directory and run

	$ capp gen <LPKit Examples Directory Name> -f --force

so you incarnate Cappuccino into the app.  Now everything should run smoothly.
